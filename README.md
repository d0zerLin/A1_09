# Using Verilog to create a simple matrix multiplier
We first tried to use Verilog code for a simple matrix multiplier. The input matrices are fixed size (2 by 2). So the output matrix is also fixed at 2 by 2. Both inputs and outputs are 32 bits, so each matrix unit consists of 8-bit binary number.
Verilog doesn't allow you to have multi dimensional arrays as inputs or output ports. So we have converted the three dimensional input and output ports to one dimensional array. Inside the module we have created 3D temporary variables which are initialized to the inputs at the beginning of the always statement. 
We also did a simple simulation, using the behavioral simulation tool in Vivado, the inputs are:

and the result turned out to be:

# Code comment and simulation result
Matrix multiplier:

//Module for calculating out = data1*data2. Where data1,data2 and out are 2 by 2 matrices.
module two_by_two(data1,data2,out); 
    //input and output ports.
    //The size 32 bits which is 2*2=4 elements,each of which is 8 bits wide.    
    input [31:0] data1;
    input [31:0] data2;
    output [31:0] out;   
    //internal variables    
    reg [31:0] out;
    reg [7:0] a1 [0:1][0:1];
    reg [7:0] b1 [0:1][0:1];
    reg [7:0] out1 [0:1][0:1]; 
    integer i,j,k;

    always@ (data1 or data2)
    begin
    //Initialize the matrices-convert 1 D to 3D arrays
        {a1[0][0],a1[0][1],a1[1][0],a1[1][1]} = data1;
        {b1[0][0],b1[0][1],b1[1][0],b1[1][1]} = data2;
        i = 0;
        j = 0;
        k = 0;
        {out1[0][0],out1[0][1],out1[1][0],out1[1][1]} = 32'd0; 
        //Matrix multiplication
        for(i=0;i < 2;i=i+1)
            for(j=0;j < 2;j=j+1)
                for(k=0;k < 2;k=k+1)
                    out1[i][j] = out1[i][j] + (a1[i][k] * b1[k][j]);
        //final output assignment - 3D array to 1D array conversion.    
        out = {out1[0][0],out1[0][1],out1[1][0],out1[1][1]};            
    end 

endmodule

Testbench Code:

module two_by_two_tb();
// Inputs
reg [31:0] data1;
reg [31:0] data2;
// Outputs
wire [31:0] out;
// Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
two_by_two T1 (.data1(data1), .data2(data2), .out(out));

    initial begin
        // Apply Inputs
        data1 = 0;  data2 = 0;  #100;
        data1 = {8'd1,8'd2,8'd3,8'd4};
        data2 = {8'd5,8'd6,8'd7,8'd8}; //[ 1 2    Ã—    [ 5 6
                                       //  3 4 ]         7 8 ]
    end
      
endmodule

Simulation waveform:

The codes were simulated using Xilinx Vivado. The following waveform verifies that the design is working correctly.
